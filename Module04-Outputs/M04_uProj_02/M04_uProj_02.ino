 *  Module Number: M04  
 *  Module Title:  Output Interfacing
 *
 *  Module Statement: Implementing S-o-S Using your arduino
 *
 *  Minimum Requirements: Get a S-o-S signal using either the Internal LED or an external LED
 *
 *  Learning Objectives: 
 *  •  Understanding How to write a arduino code
 *  •  Understanding How to solve a given problem statement using Arduino
 *  •  Interfacing an Output device (LED) to Arduino
 *  •  Understanding how to reuse previous written code and modify it as per your requirements
 *
 *  Hardware Requirements:
 *  •  Arduino Uno
 *  •  Breadboard
 *  •  [Optional] LED, 330 Ohm Resistor
 *
 *  [Optional] Hardware Connections: [If using external LED]
 *  [Arduino_Pin_9]-----------[LED-]------[Resistor1]-------[Arduino_5/3.3V_Pin]

  // Add your S-o-S code here : Code written here will run forever
  // Steps to be implemented -->
  // Step1 : LED should be turned on for 100ms
  // Step2 : LED should be turned off for 50ms
  // Step3 : LED should be turned on for 250ms
  // Step4 : LED should be turned off for 50ms
  // Step5 : LED should be turned on for 100ms
  // Step6 : LED should be turned off for 5sec

/*
 *  To program your arduino, we have to first set up which Arduino are we using. 
 *  STEP 1 : Select your arduino by clicking on : Tools > Board > Arduino Uno
 *  STEP 2 : Select the Port on which your arduino is connected by clicking on : Tools > Port > COM6
 *  STEP 3 : Click on the checkmark symbol on the top right corner to verify that the code has no errors
 *  STEP 4 : Click on the Right Arrow symbol (->) to program your arduino 
 *           (You can see the status below as well as the flashing lights on your arduino)
