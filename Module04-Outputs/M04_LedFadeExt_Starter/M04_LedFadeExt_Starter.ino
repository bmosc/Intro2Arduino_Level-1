/*
 *  To program your arduino, we have to first set up which Arduino are we using. 
 *  STEP 1 : Select your arduino by clicking on : Tools > Board > Arduino Uno
 *  STEP 2 : Select the Port on which your arduino is connected by clicking on : Tools > Port > COM6
 *  STEP 3 : Click on the checkmark symbol on the top right corner to verify that the code has no errors
 *  STEP 4 : Click on the Right Arrow symbol (->) to program your arduino 
 *           (You can see the status below as well as the flashing lights on your arduino)
